In this article we have outlined some of the best practices for remote performance reviews

## 1. Get clear on the purpose of performance reviews.

[According to a survey of more than 1,000 managers by BambooHR, only 37 percent of employees feel that their performance reviews are fair. ](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/onboarding-infographic/)This is likely because managers often don't have a clear understanding of why they are doing them.

Performance reviews should be used to help employees grow in their roles and help them understand what they need to do to achieve their goals. They should also be used to provide feedback on how they are doing in their job, and how you can help them improve.

If you're not using performance reviews as a way to help your employees grow, then they will likely feel like they are being judged unfairly or that their manager doesn't care about them.

## 2. Give timely feedback.

[Performance reviews shouldn't be a one-time thing that happens once a year in the fall.](https://www.toolbox.com/hr/performance/question/should-performance-appraisals-be-done-more-than-once-a-year-091012/) They should be given on a regular basis throughout the year so that employees can receive feedback on a regular basis and know how they are doing in their role.

It's also important to give timely feedback. If you wait too long to give feedback then employees may forget what they did or didn't do well in the previous quarter, and it may seem like you're only giving them negative feedback when they really need some positive reinforcement as well.

## 3. Give positive feedback as well as negative feedback.

[Giving negative feedback can be hard for managers, especially if they don't want to hurt someone's feelings or make them feel bad about themselves. ](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-right-way-to-give-negative-feedback-to-your-manager)But it's important to give both positive and negative feedback so that employees know what they are doing well, as well as what they need to improve on.

## 4. Don't hold back on the tough stuff because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings.

[It's important for managers to give constructive criticism when an employee isn't doing well in their role or is not meeting expectations.](https://hbr.org/2019/02/how-to-talk-to-an-employee-who-isnt-meeting-their-goals) It's also important for managers to tell employees when they are doing well so that they know when they are successfully meeting expectations and doing a good job in their role.

Telling someone that they are doing a good job is just as important as telling someone that they aren't doing a good job because it helps employees know what
