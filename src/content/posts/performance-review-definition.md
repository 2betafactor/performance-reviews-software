There are many benefits to having a remote team, but one of the downsides is that you can't always observe their work. If you're not careful, it will be very easy for your remote employees to fall into a rut and not get better at their job.

- Go around the room and have each person talk about what they've been working on lately and what they plan to work on next. This will give everyone an opportunity to speak up and share what they're working on.
- Ask each person to give an update on their goals for this year, as well as how they plan on achieving those goals. Then ask them what they need
