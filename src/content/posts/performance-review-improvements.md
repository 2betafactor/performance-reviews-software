A performance review is a process by which an employee's performance is evaluated. It is usually an annual event at which a manager and their direct reports discuss the employee's performance over the year. It can also be used to evaluate employees on a quarterly or monthly basis. The [performance review process](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution) is usually conducted in an interview format, where the manager asks the employee questions about their performance, and the employee responds to these questions.

## Here are a few examples of the types of questions you can ask in your performance appraisals:

* What did you enjoy most about the last six months?
* What has been the biggest challenge in your role?
* What is the most important thing you would like to improve about yourself?
* What is the biggest lesson you have learned in the last six months?
* How have your goals changed since last year?
* What do you want to achieve in the year?
