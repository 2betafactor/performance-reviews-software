[Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. Project managers are responsible for initiating and leading projects, coordinating resources, and ensuring that deadlines are met. To do this, project managers must be able to direct and motivate people, have good organizational and time management skills, and have excellent communication skills.

Project management can be applied to a variety of fields. Project management is most widely used in the manufacturing sector, where most of the processes are repetitive and can be improved by using project management.

Project management in manufacturing is often referred to as "conversion" or "value stream" management, as it is aimed at improving the efficiency of a process. It has been widely applied in the automotive industry, with its origins in the 1980s.

Project management techniques were developed to meet the challenges of large-scale projects, such as those required by the US government during World War II. The project management approach was developed by the US Department of Defense, and applied to all projects, including those that were not military in nature.

The [first project management standard was issued by the US Department of Defense in 1957](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/brief-history-of-project-management.php), and the second version was released in 1965. This standard was called "DoD-STD-6001". In 1968, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to create a US national standard for project management. The committee members were from both government and private industry. The committee issued the first version of the "Project Management Body of Knowledge" (PMBOK) in 1969. The second version was released in 1976.

In the 1980s, project management was recognized as a separate discipline, and the PMP certification was developed. In 1989, the Project Management Institute (PMI) was formed, and the PMBOK was updated in 1994. In 2002, the PMBOK was updated to the third edition.
