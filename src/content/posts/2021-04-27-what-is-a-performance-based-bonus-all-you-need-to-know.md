## What is a performance based bonus?

A performance based bonus is a bonus that is earned based on the performance of the company as a whole. It is usually a percentage of the employee’s salary and is paid at the end of the year, or at year end.

The most common performance based bonuses are annual and quarterly bonuses. Annual bonuses are typically paid out in December, and are based on the company’s performance over the previous year. Quarterly bonuses are usually paid out in three installments during the year, and are based on the company’s performance over the previous quarter.

## How is a performance based bonus calculated?

The calculation of a performance based bonus is usually very simple. The company will set a target for the bonus and then calculate a percentage for the employee’s bonus. The employee’s bonus is then calculated by multiplying the percentage by the employee’s salary.

For example, if the company sets a target bonus of 10%, and the employee’s salary is $50,000, the employee’s bonus will be $5,000.
