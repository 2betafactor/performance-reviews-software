With the increased reliance on remote teams, performance reviews have become more important than ever. The key to a successful performance review process is to ensure that all employees are engaged and feel comfortable in the process. This is especially important for remote workers who may feel disconnected from the organization.

## How to Improve Performance Reviews for Remote Teams

Here are some tips to make performance reviews successful for remote workers:

1. Use a software platform that allows you to manage your teamâ€™s performance reviews in one place.
2. Use a software platform that allows you to track employee performance against goals and objectives.
3. Use a software platform that allows you to schedule performance review meetings with team members.
4. Use a software platform that allows you to provide feedback both verbally and in writing.
5. Use a software platform that allows you to record and track employee progress over time.
6. Use a software platform that allows you to give feedback both verbally and in writing.

## Remore work and new ways of thinking

There is a silver lining to all of this, as remote working has opened up a new way of thinking about performance reviews. Companies have been forced to think about how they can best ensure that they are reviewing their employees fairly and consistently.

A good place to start is by having a clear understanding of the purpose of the performance review.

The purpose of the performance review is to provide feedback on the employee's performance, and to set performance targets for the next period. This feedback and these targets are used by the employee to improve their performance.

Performance reviews are not an opportunity for managers to give positive or negative feedback on an employee's personality or character, or for them to set targets that are unrealistic. It is important that managers keep these things in mind when they are reviewing their teams.

Another thing to consider is how much time should be spent on the performance review itself. It is important that managers don't let this meeting become a burden for them or their employees. As such, it is a good idea to keep the performance review as short as possible, and to make it easier for employees by allowing them to contribute to the review process.

For example, if an employee has been working from home over the past year, it would be a good idea for them to provide their manager with some examples of how they have been contributing to the company's goals from home. This will make it easier for their manager to write up their review, as well as make it easier for them to understand what they need to do in order to improve.

Employees can also benefit from being involved in setting their own performance targets. This will make it easier for them to understand what is expected of them, and will also help them feel more in control of their work life. However, it is important that managers do not give employees unrealistic targets, as this will only lead to disappointment and frustration.

The same logic applies when setting goals for remote workers in general. Managers should not set goals that assume that everyone works in an office environment, and remote workers should not be penalized if they work from home one day because they have childcare responsibilities. Instead, managers should work with remote workers to set goals that are relevant and achievable given their circumstances.
