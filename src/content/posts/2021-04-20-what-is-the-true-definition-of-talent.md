## Top performers and Talented employees

[The top performers in any field are talented](https://hbr.org/2016/10/talent-matters-even-more-than-people-think). However, the majority of people who are considered talented are not at the top of the field. The difference between being talented and being a top performer is hard work. Talent is a gift, but it doesn’t mean you will be successful. It’s the combination of talent and effort that leads to success.

[The term “talent” is often misused](https://timtortora.com/what-is-talent-anyway/). It’s not about being good at something, it’s about being great at something. If you are good at something, you can get better with practice and hard work. If you are great at something, you have a special ability that allows you to do things that others cannot. Being great at something requires more than just practice and hard work, it requires a special ability that can be developed through deliberate practice.

[Deliberate practice is a specific type of practice that is designed to improve performance by focusing on improving weaknesses while maintaining strengths.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/deliberate-practice) Deliberate practice is designed to improve performance by focusing on improving weaknesses while maintaining strengths. Deliberate practice takes dedication, focus, and effort over an extended period of time to achieve greatness. The key to deliberate practice is to focus on improving weaknesses while maintaining strengths. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean ignoring your strengths, it means improving your weaknesses to the point where they become strengths.

[A good example of a person who used deliberate practice to improve his talent is Michael Jordan](https://us.elevateeducation.com/news/parents/practice-does-not-make-perfect). Michael Jordan was not a natural athlete, he was not even the best player on his team. Michael Jordan worked harder than anyone else, and he was willing to put in the time and effort to improve his weaknesses. He spent countless hours practicing his jump shot, his footwork and his defensive skills. He would practice with his team in the morning and then practice on his own after practice. He would shoot hundreds of jump shots every day, and he would run drills until he could do them perfectly.

Michael Jordan used deliberate practice to develop his talent. He focused on improving his weaknesses while maintaining his strengths. He practiced until he could do things perfectly, and he practiced until he could do things better than anyone else in the world. Michael Jordan’s talent was developed through deliberate practice.

The key to success is not talent, it’s hard work over an extended period of time. Talent is a gift, but it’s not enough to be successful. You must combine talent with hard work and dedication to achieve success.
