   - Create detailed guidelines outlining eligibility, application processes, and expectations. Ensure that these guidelines are clear and accessible to all employees.

4. **Communicate the Policy**
   - Communicate the policy effectively to all employees. Use multiple channels such as emails, intranet, and meetings to ensure everyone is informed.

5. **Provide Training**
   - Offer training for both employees and managers to ensure they understand how to implement and manage flexible working arrangements effectively.
