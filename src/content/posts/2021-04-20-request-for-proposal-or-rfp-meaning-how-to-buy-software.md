A [request for proposal ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/request-for-proposal.asp)(RFP) is a document that describes a project and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it.

The RFP process is often used to select a contractor for a project. It may also be used to select a service provider, such as a consultant.

RFPs are often issued by governments and other large organizations that have the resources to hire contractors to complete projects. The RFP process is sometimes used by small businesses, but it is more common for large businesses to use RFPs.

## The 4 steps of the Request for Proposal process

[The RFP process has four basic steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal):

1. Preparing the document: The organization that will be issuing the RFP documents the project. It identifies the key elements of the project, such as its budget, time frame, and deliverables. It then writes the RFP to describe these elements. The organization also determines who will evaluate the bids and how they will evaluate them.
2. Disseminating the document: The organization distributes copies of the RFP to potential bidders. This is usually done by posting it on the organization's website or sending copies to interested parties.
3. Receiving bids: Bidders respond to the RFP by submitting bids. They may submit a single bid or multiple bids. Bids are typically submitted in writing, electronically, or both.
4. Evaluating bids: The entity issuing the RFP evaluates each bid received against its criteria for evaluating bids and selects a winner based on these criteria.

RFPs are similar to other types of requests for proposals (RFPs), but they differ in several ways:

RFPs are issued by organizations with the resources to hire contractors to complete projects. Other types of RFPs are issued by organizations that don't have the resources to complete projects themselves. For example, a small business might use an RFP to hire a consultant to help it develop a marketing plan.

Other types of RFPs are often issued for smaller projects, such as hiring a painter or an accountant.

The term "request for proposal" is sometimes used interchangeably with "request for information." However, there is a difference between the two:

A request for proposal (RFP) is a document that describes a project and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it.

A [request for information (RFI)](https://www.iup.edu/procurement/howto/request-for-information-(rfi)/#:~:text=The%20RFI%20is%20a%20solicitation,to%20specific%20requisitions%20for%20items.) is a document that describes a project and solicits input from interested parties.

RFPs are often issued by government entities, such as the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). They are also used by businesses, such as construction companies, and nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals.
