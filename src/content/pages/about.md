The best performance management software helps you manage development plans, assess strengths and weaknesses, and set goals for improvement. It is an essential part of improving employee training and retention, and it also helps you identify key personnel who are ready for promotion.

To clarify the benefits of performance management software, weâ€™ve created this list of the top five reasons to use performance management software:

## Create More Meaningful Feedback

Performance management software allows users to create and edit employee evaluations. The software also supports 360-degree reviews so you can get feedback from peers, subordinates, and direct supervisors. This type of feedback is more useful than feedback from just one source. In addition to being more meaningful, 360-degree reviews are also more objective than self-evaluations.

## Set Goals for Improvement

Performance management software allows managers to set goals for improvement, which can be presented to employees during annual reviews. If you use performance management software, it will be easy to see which employees need improvement in certain areas. Employees can then use the software to track their progress towards meeting their goals.
